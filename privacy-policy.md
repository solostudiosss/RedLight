# RedLight – Privacy Policy

RedLight does not collect, store, or share any personal data or user information.

The app functions entirely offline. It does not connect to the internet, transmit data, or use third-party services.
No analytics, advertising, or tracking systems are integrated.

All settings (such as brightness level) are stored locally on the user’s device and never leave it.

This app is fully usable without any permissions and respects user privacy by design.

The app includes an optional link to an external website (Buy Me a Coffee).
If the user chooses to open this link, it will launch their device’s web browser and take them outside the app.
Any data entered or processed on that external site is governed by that website’s own privacy policy.
RedLight does not track or monitor any interaction with external sites.
