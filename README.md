# RedLight

**RedLight** is a minimalist flashlight app that uses a full-screen red display instead of turning on the bright, blinding camera flash.  
It is designed for night-time use where discretion, eye comfort, and sleep preservation are essential.

Exposure to bright white or blue-tinted light at night can suppress the body's production of melatonin – a hormone crucial for healthy sleep and regulating the circadian rhythm.  
Red light, by contrast, has the gentlest impact on these natural cycles, allowing one to see without fully waking up or disrupting the body’s internal clock.

Whether returning to a shared bedroom or briefly stepping into the hallway during the night, RedLight provides gentle illumination without harsh brightness or intrusive glare.

The app includes a smooth brightness slider that remembers your last setting, opening precisely as you left it – soft or strong.  
The display remains a deep, uninterrupted red, with no interface clutter, no distractions, and no unnecessary elements.

RedLight is completely free to use – with no ads, no permissions, no network access, and no data collection of any kind.  
All settings are stored locally. The app does not connect to the internet or communicate with any external servers.

Simple. Silent. Respectful of privacy and sleep.
